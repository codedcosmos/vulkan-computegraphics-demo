# vulkan-computegraphics-demo
### By codedcosmos

It is just simple example that uses compute to generate triangles and generates them using the vulkan api.
The code quality likely won't be great since the purpose of developing this was a learning experience.
I'm simply uploading it as there aren't enough java examples for vulkan on the internet currently.

If you are using it as a reference do just note, some of this is suboptimal.

* GPLv3
* Graphics and compute
* Resizable swapchain/window
